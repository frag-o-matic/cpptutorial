### Intro
This is an experimental tutorial/course/book/whatever for introducing (and emphasizing) modern C++ language, practices and idioms rather than following the traditional C-first style introduction to C++. The trigger for creating this tutorial was this [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnWhqhNdYyk) by Kate Gregory. 

The tutorial itself is aimed at people with some exposure to programming, possibly using other languages, however knowledege of C is neither assumed nor required. That said, absolute beginners and first time programming learners may face problems following along. Basic proficiency with Linux (or another UNIX-like) will be helpful.
