### Intro
This is an experimental tutorial/course/book for introducing (and emphasizing) modern C++ language, practices and idioms rather than following the traditional learn-C-first style of introducing to C++. The trigger for creating this tutorial was this [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnWhqhNdYyk) by Kate Gregory. 

The tutorial itself is aimed at people with some exposure to programming, possibly using other languages. Knowledege of C is neither assumed nor required. That said, absolute beginners and people very new to programming may face problems following this tutorial. Basic proficiency with Linux (or another UNIX-like OS) will be necessary to try out exercise, although links will be to online compilers executing sample code.
